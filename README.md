# Rich Text Editor

This project is to create a rich text editor with plain HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. No frameworks. No need to use a package manager or even use dependencies.

## Set up

1. Clone the project with git clone https://github.com/victornguyen75/rich-text-editor.git in the terminal
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser

## Notes for Future Improvements

1. `document.execCommand()` is a deprecated feature according to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand). For the purposes of this project, this is fine. For larger, enterprise applications, it might be best to look at an alternative.
2. It would be nice to add checkboxes.
3. When creating links, it would be nice to have clickable anchor tags. As of now, the user would have to right click on their newly created links and open them up manually.
